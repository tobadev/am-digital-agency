SESSION EXPORT — 2026-02-15
============================

## WHAT WAS DONE THIS SESSION

### 1. Gray → Neutral sweep (ALL files)
- Replaced every `gray-*` Tailwind class with `neutral-*` across 14 files
- Kills the blue/cool undertone from Tailwind's default gray scale
- Now pure neutral grays matching brand colors (#050505, #0a0a0a)

### 2. Padding consistency fix
- About, Contact, Services: `px-4 md:px-8` → `px-6 md:px-10`

### 3. Stagger animations added
- About, Contact, Services, Work rows now have `animate-in fade-in slide-in-from-bottom-4` with incrementing `animationDelay` + `animationFillMode: 'both'`
- Matches CaseStudy.tsx which was the only page doing it correctly

### 4. Hover states added
- About values rows: `group-hover:translate-x-3` on titles, `group-hover:text-neutral-500` on numbers
- Services rows: same hover pattern on service titles, engagement titles

### 5. About page — new sections added
- Team directory: Andrija Milosevic (Founder), Luka Petrovic (Account Manager), Daria Morozova (DACH Account Manager), Aleksa Velickovic (Outreach Specialist), Nikita Kozlov (Outreach Specialist)
- Sorted by position (Founder → Managers → Specialists)
- Each name is a mailto link (amilosevic@, lpetrovic@, dmorozova@, avelickovic@, nkozlov@amdigital.agency)
- Selected clients section: Dachreach, Clyra.biz, Calem.app, CostaeAI, Veltrix
- Header rewritten: "Independent studio. Global reach."

### 6. Services page — new sections added
- Sectors/Industries section with pill tags (rounded-full): SaaS & Platforms, E-commerce, FinTech, Healthcare, B2B, Real Estate, Startups, Enterprise
- Removed duplicate CTA (Footer already has one)

### 7. globals.css cleanup
- Removed dead animations: float, glitch, blob keyframes
- Removed .glitch-bg class
- Removed brand-gray and brand-lightGray color tokens (old template)
- Only brand-black (#050505), brand-dark (#0a0a0a), brand-accent (#ffffff) remain

### 8. Misc fixes
- Work.tsx: `bg-brand-gray` → `bg-brand-dark`
- Footer: copyright hardcoded 2025 → `{new Date().getFullYear()}`

### 9. Homepage — PARTIAL rebuild
- Stripped Process.tsx and Testimonials.tsx from homepage
- Removed old z-index wrapper from page.tsx
- Hero.tsx rebuilt — USER APPROVED THIS:
  - Centered, full-viewport, massive `clamp(3rem,10vw,12rem)` headline
  - "We build digital products that work."
  - Single CTA button centered below
  - Bottom info strip: "AM Digital Agency" / "London, UK — Est. 2023" / "Strategy / Design / Development"
  - Staggered animations (300ms headline, 800ms CTA, 1200ms bottom strip)
  - NO numbered rows, NO borders, NO section labels — genuinely different from inner pages
- ServicesHome.tsx rebuilt — USER DID NOT APPROVE:
  - I made it with broken word typography (Str/ate/gy) in 3 columns
  - User said it's still "the same shit" — needs to be GENUINELY different from inner pages
  - THIS NEEDS TO BE REDONE IN NEXT SESSION

### 10. Homepage composition is now:
- Hero → ServicesHome → Work → Footer
- Process and Testimonials removed from homepage

## WHAT STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE

### CRITICAL — Homepage ServicesHome section
- Hero is APPROVED
- ServicesHome needs complete rethink — must NOT use numbered rows, border-t separators, or any pattern from inner pages
- The research says: "Let project tags imply capabilities" or "1-3 high-level service labels" without full taxonomy
- Consider: Lottie animations for each service, or just let Work section's project tags carry the capability story
- Maybe don't even need a separate services section — research shows Locomotive and Dogstudio skip it on homepage entirely

### HIGH — Terms.tsx and Privacy.tsx
- Still completely old template
- Wrong padding (px-4 md:px-8), wrong max-width (max-w-4xl), uses `prose` class
- Need: max-w-5xl, px-6 md:px-10, pb-32, system heading, stagger animations

### MEDIUM — Work section on homepage
- Currently shows ALL 5 projects — research says homepage should show 3-4 curated pieces max
- Layout should be different from /work page (more visual, fewer details)
- Currently identical to /work page

### LOW — Section label colors
- Some use text-neutral-500, some text-neutral-600
- Should standardize

## PERPLEXITY RESEARCH — HOMEPAGE (user provided this)

Key findings from researching Locomotive, Active Theory, Fantasy, Dogstudio, BASIC:

1. HERO = brand thesis + immediate proof, NOT information header
   - Centered massive type, minimal copy, one CTA
   - Bottom strip with credentials (like we built — APPROVED)

2. SERVICES PREVIEW on homepage:
   - Fantasy: 3 numeric labels, no borders, minimal
   - Locomotive: NO services section — capabilities inferred from featured work tags
   - Dogstudio: NO services section — moves straight to featured projects
   - BASIC: Featured engagements rail instead of services
   - Active Theory: NO services listed at all
   - KEY INSIGHT: "Let case tags and captions carry the capability story"

3. WORK PREVIEW on homepage:
   - 4-6 flagship cases, curated, NOT the full archive
   - Different layout from Work page — "oversized imagery, scroll-snapped sections"
   - Emotional one-liners, not factual descriptions
   - "Homepage work module should have its own composition"

4. VISUAL DIFFERENCES:
   - Homepage: poster-like, big type, big media, low UI noise
   - Homepage: choreographed motion across sections
   - Homepage: sparse, declarative, emotional copy
   - Inner pages: grid/list-based, repeatable blocks, more conventional hierarchy

5. LOTTIE: User mentioned wanting Lottie animations, potentially for services

## PERPLEXITY RESEARCH — AGENCY PAGES (from earlier)

Key findings for About and Services pages:

About (Locomotive pattern): hero → positioning → manifesto → capabilities → team by discipline → awards
Services (BASIC pattern): 3-4 big categories → detail pages with metrics + featured work
Dogstudio tone: opinionated, call out who you DON'T want as clients
Fantasy density: resist over-explaining, push detail into case studies

## DESIGN SYSTEM REFERENCE

- Black (#050505) + white + Tailwind neutral-* (NO gray-*)
- border-t border-white/10 as separators (INNER PAGES ONLY — homepage should NOT use these)
- Section labels: text-xs uppercase tracking-[0.3em] (above headings)
- Row labels: text-[10px] uppercase tracking-[0.2em] (inline with numbers)
- Page headings: text-6xl md:text-8xl lg:text-9xl
- Content: max-w-5xl, px-6 md:px-10
- Spacing: mb-40 header gaps
- Hover: group-hover:translate-x-3
- Animations: animationDelay + animationFillMode: 'both'
- Font: Poppins (font-display + font-sans)
- Pills: rounded-full
- NO rounded cards, NO grey boxes, NO gradient blobs, NO backdrop-blur
