===============================

## WHAT WAS DONE THIS SESSION

### 1. Homepage complete rebuild
- Removed ServicesHome.tsx from homepage (rejected twice last session)
- New flow: Hero -> BrandStatement -> WorkHome -> Clients -> Footer

### 2. BrandStatement.tsx — NEW COMPONENT
- Single editorial sentence, two-tone text
- "An independent London digital agency" (white) + "helping ambitious companies define strategy, shape brands, and build products people actually use." (starts #404040, reveals to white)
- Scroll-reveal effect: word-by-word transition from dim to white as user scrolls
- Left-aligned with md:max-w-[75%] creating asymmetric negative space
- Uses useRef + scroll event listener for progress tracking

### 3. WorkHome.tsx — NEW COMPONENT
- 3 curated projects: NovaBank, Aura Home, Meridian
- Asymmetric image grid: first project full-width aspect-[16/9], next two side-by-side aspect-[4/3]
- Title + category overlaid on images with gradient overlay
- Hover: image scale-105 + overlay darkens
- "All projects" link with arrow button at bottom-right
- Completely different from /work page (no rows, no borders, no numbers)

### 4. Clients.tsx — NEW COMPONENT
- Horizontal centered row of 5 client names
- Dot separators between names (hidden on mobile)
- text-sm md:text-base text-neutral-600 uppercase tracking-[0.2em]

### 5. Footer.tsx — restructured
- Asymmetric grid: md:grid-cols-[2fr_1fr_1fr] — Contact gets double width
- Contact expanded: email + full address (27 Old Gloucester Street, London, WC1N 3AX, UK)
- Navigation: stripped numbered prefixes (was 01 Home, now just Home)
- Socials: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn (removed X/Twitter)
- Bottom bar consolidated: "© 2026 AM Digital Agency Ltd · Company No. 14167111"
- Single "Legal" link (replaced separate Privacy + Terms links)

### 6. Legal page — NEW (consolidated Terms + Privacy)

- Sections: Company Information, Privacy Policy, Intellectual Property, Limitation of Liability
- Two-column layout (label left, content right)
- Styled with design system: max-w-5xl, px-6 md:px-10, stagger animations
- No prose class, no old template styling
- Company info: AM Digital Agency Ltd, Company No. 14167111, registered address

### 7. NovaBank thumbnail fix
- Old Unsplash URL was 404
- Swapped to working URL from gallery: photo-1551288049-bebda4e38f71

### 8. Navbar fixes
- mix-blend-difference disabled when menu is open (was causing transparency issues on mobile)
- Nav links area: added min-h-0 overflow-y-auto (was pushing bottom bar off-screen on FHD)
- Bottom bar: added shrink-0 so language switchers always visible

### 9. Final skill audit — all passed
- About.tsx: "Independent studio." -> "Independent digital agency. Global reach."
- Contact.tsx: /privacy link -> /legal
- Section label colors standardized to text-neutral-500 (CaseStudy, Footer CTA, Legal were text-neutral-600)

## WHAT STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE

### NEXT — i18n + SEO
- English as default (stays as /)
- German: /de/ with German route names (kontakt, dienstleistungen, etc.)
- Italian: /it/ with Italian route names
- French: /fr/ with French route names
- German requires Impressum page
- SEO: metadata, hreflang tags, sitemap
- Language switcher in navbar already exists (EN/DE/FR/IT) but needs wiring

### MEDIUM — Lottie animations
- User wants Lottie integrated (mentioned for services or homepage)

### LOW — Dead pages cleanup
- /terms and /privacy routes still exist but nothing links to them
- Can be removed after i18n is set up

### LOW — Placeholder content
- All 5 projects use Unsplash placeholder images
- Social links (#) need real URLs

## SKILL FILE LOCATION
.agents/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md

- User is AM (Andrija Milosevic), founder of AM Digital Agency, London UK
- User speaks Serbian sometimes when frustrated
- User is very particular about PREMIUM quality — always verify with skills
- ALWAYS consult skill BEFORE building, not after
- Homepage MUST feel different from inner pages — this is now achieved
- Hero: APPROVED, BrandStatement: APPROVED, WorkHome: APPROVED
