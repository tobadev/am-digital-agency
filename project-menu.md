# Start a Project — Menu Placement

## Decision
"Start a project" CTA was removed from the Hero to make room for larger typography + future Lottie on "work."

## Where to place it
**Elevate Contact (item 05) in the menu overlay** instead of adding a new element.

The menu is already heavy:
- 5 big nav links
- Bottom bar with email, location, 4 language buttons
- Staggered animations

Adding more would tip it from "designed" to "stuffed."

## Approach
- Rename item 05 from "Contact" to "Start a project" (or keep "Contact")
- Give it a distinct visual treatment — pill border, accent color, or visual break
- Add a subtle separator before it to set it apart from items 01-04
- No new elements, just elevate what's already there

## Why not navbar?
- Persistent CTA on every page is a SaaS/startup pattern, not premium agency
- Feels pushy — premium agencies trust the work to sell
- Clutters the clean logo + menu pill layout

## TODO
- [ ] Decide: rename to "Start a project" or keep "Contact"
- [ ] Choose visual treatment for the standout item
- [ ] Implement and test
- [ ] Consider Lottie animation on "work." in Hero (separate task)
